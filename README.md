# GroupStrip
 
GroupStrip is a OS-agnostic batch management platform inspired by [MKVOptimizer](https://www.videohelp.com/software/MKV-Optimizer). It runs in a dockerized container with a locally accessible Web GUI, much like [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) (has queue, can have different directories formatting differently, asynchronous processes), and integrates with [MKVToolNix](https://mkvtoolnix.download) to provide easy batch management for baked-in tracks on your video files.
